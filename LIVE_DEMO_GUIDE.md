```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "services": {
    "ai": false,
    "ipfs": false, 
    "redis": false,
    "web3": true
  },
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T03:33:11.964109"
}
```

**Say:** *"Our robust backend handles AI processing and blockchain integration. As you can see, the system is healthy and connected to the blockchain."*

### Test Blockchain Connection:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/blockchain-status
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "account": "0xE1A70fe5807fD64c3341212cF3F9Fe117300c34E",
  "block_number": 8658789,
  "connected": true,
  "contract_address": null,
  "network": 11155111
}
```

**Say:** *"We're successfully connected to the Sepolia testnet and ready to process transactions."*

## **Step 4: AI Disease Detection Demo (2 minutes)**

### Upload a Photo:

1. **Go back to browser** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Click "Choose Photo"** button
3. **Select a crop image** (have 2-3 ready)
4. **Watch real-time processing**

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "crop_type": "tomato",
  "is_healthy": false,
  "disease": "early_blight", 
  "confidence": 95.2
}
```

**Say:** *"Let's upload a crop photo and see our AI in action. Our 39-class CNN model can detect diseases with 95% accuracy."*

### Show Results:
- **Crop Type**: "AI correctly identified this as a tomato plant"
- **Disease Detection**: "Detected early blight disease"
- **Confidence**: "95.2% confidence level"
- **Health Status**: "Marked as unhealthy for treatment"
