2. **"Market Intelligence Function"** - *[Show real-time data]*
   - "Instantly pulls current corn prices: $6.42 per bushel, up 2.3%"
   - "Weather forecast integration shows high disease risk"
   - "Recommends immediate treatment"

3. **"Community Alert Function"** - *[Trigger alert]*
   - "Disease severity triggers automatic alert to 1,247 nearby farmers"
   - "89.2% response rate - this creates viral network effects"

### **Step 3: Blockchain Proof (30 seconds)**
*[Switch to Etherscan]*

**"Here's the blockchain proof - transaction hash on Sepolia:"**
- "200 AGRO tokens automatically minted to farmer's wallet"
- "Disease detection recorded immutably"
- "Community alert broadcasted"

*[Show MetaMask wallet update]*

**"Farmer just earned $40 worth of tokens for early detection!"**

### **Step 4: Purchase Flow (45 seconds)**
*[Switch to marketplace]*

**"Now watch the economic incentives work:"**

1. **"Dynamic Pricing"** - *[Show product page]*
   - "Treatment costs $100, but farmer gets 20% token discount"
   - "Pays only $80 - saved $20 for early detection"

2. **"Token Economy"** - *[Process purchase]*
   - "Uses 50 AGRO tokens + $60 fiat"
   - "Gets 10% cashback: 10 more AGRO tokens"
   - "Treatment tracking automatically initiated"

3. **"Insurance Integration"** - *[Show insurance function]*
   - "If treatment fails, satellite verification triggers automatic payout"
   - "No paperwork, no delays - just smart contracts"

### **Step 5: Treatment Tracking (20 seconds)**
*[Show treatment monitoring]*

**"Treatment Tracking Function monitors recovery:"**
- "78% progress, 92.1% effectiveness"
- "Farmer eligible for 150 bonus tokens for successful treatment"
- "Creates positive feedback loop for platform adoption"
